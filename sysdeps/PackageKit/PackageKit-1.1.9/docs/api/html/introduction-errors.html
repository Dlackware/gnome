<p>
      If you have to handle an error, try to use <code class="literal">internal-error</code>
      as little as possible.
      Just ask on the mailing list, and we can add some more error enums to
      cover the type of error in an abstract way as possible.
    </p>
<p>
      Every error should have an enumerated type
      (e.g. <code class="literal">out-of-memory</code>) and also an error description.
      The error description is not translated and not converted into the users
      locale.
      The error description should be descriptive, as it's for power users
      and people trying to debug the problem.
      For instance, "Out of memory" is not helpful as an error description
      that is reported in a bugzilla, but "Could not create database index" is.
      For the description use <code class="literal">;</code> to separate the lines if
      required.
    </p>
<p>
      The following error enumerated types are available for use in all
      backends:
    </p>

              Not supported by the backend.
              NOTE: You shouldn't be setting non-NULL in the compiled
              backend symbol table if you find yourself using this.

	      Multiple package installs were attempted, but all of

              should only use this if the filter is not supported by the
              backend.
