SassC is a wrapper around libsass (http://github.com/sass/libsass) used
to generate a useful command-line application that can be installed and
packaged for several operating systems.

Sass is a CSS pre-processor language to add on exciting, new, awesome
features to CSS. Sass was the first language of its kind and by far the
most mature and up to date codebase.

Sass was originally concieved of by the co-creator of this library,
Hampton Catlin (@hcatlin). Most of the language has been the result of
years of work by Natalie Weizenbaum (@nex3) and Chris Eppstein
(@chriseppstein).
