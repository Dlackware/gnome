LibSass - Sass compiler written in C++

LibSass is just a library! If you want to use LibSass to compile Sass,
you need an implementer.

Some implementations are only bindings into other programming
languages. But most also ship with a command line interface (CLI) you
can use directly.

There is also SassC, which is the official lightweight CLI tool built
by the same people as LibSass.

sassc is available on SlackBuilds.org.
