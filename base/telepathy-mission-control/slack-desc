# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

telepathy-mission-control: managers, to provide a simple way to manipulate a bunch of connection
telepathy-mission-control: managers at once, and to remove the need to have in each program the
telepathy-mission-control: account definitions and credentials.
