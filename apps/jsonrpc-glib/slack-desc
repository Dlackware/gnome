# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

jsonrpc-glib: jsonrpc-glib (library to communicate using JSON-RPC 2.0)
jsonrpc-glib:
jsonrpc-glib: Jsonrpc-GLib is a library to communicate with JSON-RPC based peers
jsonrpc-glib: in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion. It also allows
jsonrpc-glib: communicating using the GVariant serialization format instead of JSON
jsonrpc-glib: when both peers support it. You might want that when communicating
jsonrpc-glib: on a single host to avoid parser overhead and memory-allocator
jsonrpc-glib: fragmentation.
